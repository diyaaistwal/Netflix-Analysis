## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is **`dataset_netflix.csv`**, which contains the following columns:
- `show_id`: Unique identifier for each show or movie.
- `type`: Indicates whether the entry is a "Movie" or a "TV Show".
- `title`: Title of the show or movie.
- `director`: Name of the director.
- `country`: Country of production.
- `date_added`: Date when the show or movie was added to Netflix.
- `release_year`: Year when the show or movie was released.
- `rating`: Age rating for the content.
- `duration`: Duration of movies (in minutes) or TV shows (in seasons).
- `listed_in`: Genres/categories of the show or movie.

## Tasks
The following tasks are part of this project:

### **Task 1: Breaking Down a Timestamp**
- **Objective**: Break the `date_added` column into three new columns:
  - `month_added`: Full month name (e.g., "September").
  - `year_added`: Year (e.g., 2020).
  - `day_added`: Full day name (e.g., "Monday").
  
### **Task 2: Count of TV Shows**
- **Objective**: Find the total count of TV shows available on Netflix.
- **Hint**: Use the `type` column to filter rows where the value is "TV Show".

### **Task 3: Movies Released in December**
- **Objective**: Identify how many movies were added to Netflix during the high-demand month of December.
- **Hint**: Filter rows where `type` is "Movie" and `month_added` is "December".

### **Task 4: Median Movie Duration**
- **Objective**: Calculate the median duration of movies available on Netflix.
- **Hint**: Filter the dataset to only include rows where `type` is "Movie", and then compute the median of the `duration` column.

### **Task 5: Country with Maximum Titles**
- **Objective**: Find the country with the highest number of titles (both TV shows and movies).
- **Hint**: Group the data by `country` and count the number of titles for each country.

### **Task 6: Country with Maximum TV Shows and Movies**
- **Objective**: Identify the country with the maximum number of both TV shows and movies.
- **Hint**: Similar to Task 5, but considering both `type` values ("Movie" and "TV Show") in the analysis.

### **Task 7: Median Duration of Movies**
- **Objective**: Calculate the median duration of movies in Netflixâ€™s catalog.
- **Hint**: Filter for `type` as "Movie", then calculate the median of the `duration` column.
